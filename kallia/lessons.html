                        Our club provides junior courses for children over 4 years old. During these lessons, we make sure that the children
                        are having fun and, at the same time, they are training and improving their abilities. The coaches of these departments
                        are specially trained so that they can manage young ages with consistency and make the lesson enjoyable. Classes last
                        about one to two hours and take place twice a week. Children and/or parents can, in collaboration with the coaches,
                        determine the weekly schedule of the lessons.

                        For adults we have special training courses, as well as experienced coaches who are prepared to train our members,
                        even if they have never played tennis. Each member can take classes for three to four hours twice a week and the
                        training schedule can be set by the members in collaboration with our coaches and staff. The adult sections are
                        divided into three groups, depending on the student's experience in the sport. Group 1 is the the beginner's group,
                        where you can choose if it's your first time playing tennis or you have played very few times. Group 2 is for people
                        who have been involved in the sport for a short period of time and want to gain more experience. Group 3 consists of
                        members who play tennis for a long time and their purpose is to gain experience at a professional level. The team in
                        which each member is classified is determined by the coaches, after consulting with the trainees.

                        For our members who want to spend more time in the sport and gain a lot of experience in a short period of time this is
                        the best option. In these courses, each trainee has the option of taking private lessons with one of our coaches for
                        2 to 3 hours every five to six times a week, or even every day. The trainee does not need to have any previous experience
                        with tennis, as he can learn what is needed during the courses.

                        The competition courses are open to all those who want to take part in tennis matches and need to practice properly.
                        For these courses we have specially trained coaches, who will train the contestants as much as necessary, will
                        inform them properly about the competiton process and will guide them on the road to victory. The schedule of
                        the training is determined by the trainee in consultation with his coach and is typically set to contain about three
                        hours of training each day, four to five days a week. Prior to the competitions, the competitor will train
                        intensively and, on the competition day, they will participate accompanied by their coach.
