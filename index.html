                    For years sports in our area had been neglected, with facilities being scarse and of low quality. Our team, motivated by our mutual passion for tennis, fitness
                    and quality entertainment have dedicated our lives to creating a tennis club our community can be proud of. 10 years later we can proudly say we've achieved our 
                    objective. 
                    Our club has been a center for all kinds of sport related or not events, serving as a meeting spot for the community and particularly the local youth. But it's 
                    not only the locals that visit seeing as we have the honor of having been multiple years in a row awarded as the best Tennis Club in the general vicinity of west 
                    Attica. Local, Greek and European tournaments have and keep being hosted in our courts for all kinds of skill levels, even professional. 
                    Villia Tennis Club has something to offer to everyone. Visit us not only to play tennis on one of our 12 specially adjusted courts but also for a swim on our 
                    olympic dimensions pool, for a tour on the mountain or just to taste our chefs' award winning cooking. Or visit us during one of our summer events to listen 
                    to world known music and enjoy local drinks and international deserts.
